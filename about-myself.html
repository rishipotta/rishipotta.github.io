<b> --> About me: I am 13 years old and am currently going to Willard Middle School, My favorite color would be a lightish green. I dont really like math and my favorite subject is science. I used to play the voilin and flute but then I stopped playing them because I found instruments boring. I also joined a Website Developement Bootcamp to learn how to make my own website from scratch!<b/>
